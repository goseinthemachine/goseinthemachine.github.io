switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    //Statements executed when the
    //result of expression matches value1
    [break;]
  case value2:
    //Statements executed when the
    //result of expression matches value2
    [break;]
  ...
  case valueN:
    //Statements executed when the
    //result of expression matches valueN
    [break;]
  [default:

* Daily Challenge
-[[https://codepen.io/rockygg/pen/MWyMyqe?editors=0010ii][ Another Code Pen Challenge]]
* Daily Challenge
 - Questions
* Edge Cases
- Watch out for them
- Can break your applications
- Think about outside intended use cases
- 0, null, undefined, empty strings

* Debugging
- If you can have someone else look at your code
- Console.log is your friend.
- Also you can use debugger
- Get comortable reading errors
- Get comfortable reading documentation
- Commit your code in smaller chunks of working functionality
